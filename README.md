Hi, I’m Zhaleh — a curious mind with a focus on thoughtful and creative work. I like things to feel natural, grounded, and real, both in conversation and in what I create.

I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at McMaster University. Lately, my work centers around Resource allocation and Stochastic Systems, Demand Forecasting and Operational Optimization AI in Healthcare and Applications of Machine Learning in OR.

I am interested in exploring the spaces where ideas, design, and human experience intersect. Whether I’m building, writing, or problem-solving, I’m always looking for clarity, depth, and meaning.
