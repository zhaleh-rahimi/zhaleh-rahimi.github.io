I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at McMaster University, building on my previous degrees in Computer Engineering and an MBA. My journey in software engineering has instilled in me a strong appreciation for the entire software development lifecycle, from initial design to ongoing maintenance. 

During my graduate studies, I developed a keen interest in artificial intelligence, culminating in my masters' thesis, where I explored the application of machine learning to identify risk factors for complications in hemodialysis patients. This intersection of smart technology, business, and customer care has been a driving force in my academic and professional pursuits.

Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to wear multiple hats, including roles as a developer and technical consultant. These experiences have deepened my understanding of how technology can create meaningful impact, and they inspired me to tackle more complex challenges through research.

In my PhD work, I am focusing on an interdisciplinary project centered around demand forecasting for blood-derived products, particularly immunoglobulin. This project presents fascinating complexities, including the need to account for the heterogeneity and availability of these products. I employ techniques for clustering and forecasting heterogeneous, unbalanced time series, and I am working on optimizing ordering policies within a multivariate system characterized by non-independent and identically distributed demands. The intertwined dependencies of demand across multiple items add layers of complexity to my research, which I have been excited to explore in my thesis chapters.
