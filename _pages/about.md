I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at McMaster University, working at the intersection of machine learning and operations research. My research focuses on building data-driven models for decision-making under uncertainty, particularly in systems characterized by limited data, demand heterogeneity, and strong interdependencies.

My work spans clustering-based forecasting for heterogeneous and unbalanced time series, dependence-aware inventory optimization for multi-item systems, and data-driven joint replenishment strategies. I am especially interested in sequential decision-making and MDP formulations, including how deep reinforcement learning can be combined with classical optimization methods to learn robust and practical policies.

With a background in software engineering, computer engineering, and business, I approach ML research with an end-to-end mindset—from data modeling and algorithm design to implementation and operational impact. I work primarily in Python and PyTorch, and I am motivated by problems where machine learning models directly support high-stakes decisions in domains such as healthcare and supply chains.
